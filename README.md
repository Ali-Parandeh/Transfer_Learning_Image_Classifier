# Transfer Learning Image Classifier

A command line application that lets users define their own classifier, attach it to a Convolutional Neural Network, train it and save it to a checkpoint. Then load it later on to classify images of flowers from large number of classes.

In this project I first built this image classifier with PyTorch in Jupyter Notebooks, then converted it into a command line application.
