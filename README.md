# Transfer Learning Image Classifier

A command line application that:

- Lets users define their own classifier and hyperparameters, attach it to a Convolutional Neural Network, train it and save it to a checkpoint on any user-defined directory. 
- The users can also load other trained models (checkpoints) to classify images of from large number of classes and see top K classes & predictions. 
- Both training and prediction functions can be done on both the CPU or GPU as specified by the user.
- I have also provided a pre-trained CNN that can classify images of flowers up to 102 categories up to 93.5% accuracy.

In this project I first built this image classifier with PyTorch in Jupyter Notebooks, then converted it into a command line application.

**This is the final project that needs to be completed and submitted to Udacity for review as major part of passing their AI Programming with Python Nanodegree.**
